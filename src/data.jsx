E) Evaluation & Submission

For the Enhanced Data Privacy Management System (EDPMS) project, Google will apply a rigorous evaluation process to select the most suitable vendor. The evaluation criteria are designed to ensure that the chosen vendor not only meets the technical requirements but also aligns with Google’s values and strategic goals.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Technical Expertise (30%): Vendors must demonstrate a strong background in data privacy, security, and cloud-based solutions. This includes a proven track record of developing similar systems and the ability to integrate with existing Google infrastructure.
2. Innovation and Approach (20%): Vendors should present innovative approaches to solving privacy challenges, particularly in areas of consent management, data minimization, and user transparency. Proposals that include advanced technologies such as AI or machine learning for privacy enhancement will be scored higher.
3. Cultural Competency (15%): Vendors must show a commitment to integrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives into the project, as outlined in the Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). This includes experience working with Indigenous communities and businesses.
4. Project Management and Timelines (15%): The vendor’s ability to manage the project efficiently and adhere to the proposed timeline is critical. This includes having a clear project plan, risk management strategies, and a history of delivering projects on time.
5. Cost-Effectiveness (20%): While quality and innovation are paramount, cost will also play a significant role. Vendors must provide a detailed cost breakdown and justify the value of their proposed solutions in relation to the budget.

Disqualification Criteria:
Immediate disqualification will occur if a vendor:
- Fails to meet the basic technical requirements or lacks experience in data privacy systems.
- Does not demonstrate a clear commitment to the RAP objectives.
- Submits a proposal that significantly exceeds the budget without clear justification.

Submission Instructions:
Vendors are required to submit their proposals electronically via the designated Google procurement portal. All submissions must include a cover letter, detailed proposal, and relevant supporting documents. Proposals should be submitted no later than October 15, 2024, at 5:00 PM PST. Late submissions will not be considered. Google reserves the right to request additional information or clarifications during the evaluation process. Final decisions will be communicated to all vendors by November 1, 2024.
